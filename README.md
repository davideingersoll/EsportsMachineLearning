This is a hobby project I adopted to better understand neural networks and feature engineering. 
- Polls API for match results
- Organizes responses into coherent dataframes
- Engineers features for Machine Learning
- Constructs neural net model to create predictions
    - embedding
    - multihead attention
    - several dense layers with batch norm and dropout
    - Binary classification output (win/loss)
- 65% accuracy at the individual game level for predicting matchup between any 6 players
